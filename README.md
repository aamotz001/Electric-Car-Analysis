# Assesing Value of Electric Vehicles: Which Electric Car is the Best Value?

__Authors:__ Alyssa Allende Motz, Matthew DeYoung, Shihab Humayun, Peter Nielson and Eric Williams

## Motivation
The goal of our project is to analyze the value of electric vehicles over the past ten years. We chose this topic as it is of value from a financial perspective, interesting from a societal perspective and importantly, has a large variety of data sets available to use in analysis. The principle questions we intend to anwer are: what is the best valued car and what price point should a company strive to reach in order to produce a cost competitive car? 

## Background Information
The US vehicle market is projected to experience a disruption by electric vehicles in the upcoming decades. Electric vehiciles most obviously offer reduced impact to the environment, however there are cost advantages as well such as the significant reduction in cost spent on fuel and maintenance coupled with tax incentives offered by state laws. There is a huge potential for sales to explode in the near future. 

## Approach
Our approach will utilize the skills developed during the past few months to make an assesment of a given electric vehicle as to whether or not it is a "good" value. This is ultimately a subjective quality so we will do our best to take real, quantified parameters, such as vehicle and fueling costs, driving range, proximity to charging stations and local tax incentives to draw a comparison between various electric vehicles.

### Data Sets & Technology
The following centers have a wide variety of data sets that will be of use to our analysis:

### Analysis
We plan to analyze "Value," using an acumulative variable which encompasses the following parameters:

* Range
* Price
* Efficiency
* Tax Incentive
* Charging Time/Cost for charge (House Specific)
* 10 Year Span of Data (Sales and Gas Prices) Gas vs Electric
* Charging Station, Gas Prices, Car Sales, State (Tax Incentives)
