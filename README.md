__Authors:__ Alyssa Allende Motz, Matthew DeYoung, Shihab Humayun, Peter Nielson and Eric Williams

## Motivation
The goal of our project is to analyze the value of electric vehicles over the past ten years. We chose this topic as it is of value from a financial perspective, interesting from a societal perspective and importantly, has a large variety of data sets available to use in analysis. The principle questions we intend to anwer are: what is the best valued car and what price point should a company strive to reach in order to produce a cost competitive car? 

## Background Information
The US vehicle market is projected to experience a disruption by electric vehicles in the upcoming decades. Electric vehiciles most obviously offer reduced impact to the environment, however there are cost advantages as well such as the significant reduction in cost spent on fuel and maintenance coupled with tax incentives offered by state laws. There is a huge potential for sales to explode in the near future.
